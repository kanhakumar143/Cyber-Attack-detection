# Cyber-Attack-detection

## Cyber Security 
- *Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.*
-  It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
## Why need machine learning in Cybersecurity ??

- *Cybersecurity is the convergence of people, processes and technology that come together to protect organizations, individuals or networks from digital attacks.*

- With machine learning, cybersecurity systems can analyze patterns and learn from them to help prevent similar attacks and respond to changing behavior.
- Day by day number of cyber attack is increases, to detect the cyber attack we use ML(Machine Learning)
- More network logs that make difficult to analyze it manually.
- Increases more IOT devices.
- Detecting Zero day attacks (attacks on software code, conduct code reviews, and attempt to find new vulnerabilities that may have been introduced after a software update).
- **Cyber crime for SALE**
- IDS(Intrusion Detection Systems) and IPS( Intrusion Prevention Systems) are mostly patten based devises, we known the output.
- More sophisticated attacks(almost 95% attack), to detect we use ML.
- Protect **BIG Data**

## Basic types of cyber attacks
1. Sexting 
   - Sexting is the act of sending sexually explicit messages or photos electronically, primarily between mobile phones, but can include internet applications such as MSN, email, or social networking sites. [more details](https://www.cybersafetysolutions.com.au/sexting/)
2. Social Engineering
   - Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information. [more details](https://www.webroot.com/in/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-social-engineering)
3. Pharming 
   - Pharming[a] is a cyberattack intended to redirect a website's traffic to another, fake site. Pharming can be conducted either by changing the hosts file on a victim's computer or by exploitation of a vulnerability in DNS server software.
   - Pharming requires unprotected access to target a computer, such as altering a customer's home computer, rather than a corporate business server. [more details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharming)
4. Vishing Attack
   - Vishing is a cybercrime that uses the phone to steal personal confidential information from victims. Often referred to as voice phishing, cybercriminals use savvy social engineering tactics to convince victims to act, giving up private information and access to bank accounts.[more details](https://terranovasecurity.com/what-is-vishing/)
5. Phishing 
   - Phishing attacks are the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. It is usually done through email. [more details](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_in/products/security/email-security/what-is-phishing.html)
6. Smishing
   - the act of using mobile phone text messages (SMS) to lure victims into immediate action. This action may include  downloading mobile malware, visiting a malicious website or calling a fraudulent phone number.[more details](https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/attack-vectors/smishing/)
   
## Challengs
- Lack of labelled samples and certainty in ground truth
- Large data size
- High Dimensionality
- Imbalanced dataset
- Data preprocessing
- High performance computing system
## Ports in Network Devices
- Port
  - Port is the way to access any Network Devices
  - TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) Port - The TCP port is a unique number assigned to different applications. Total no of TCP ports 65535.
  - UDP(User Datagram Protocol) Port - Total no of TCP ports 65535.
  - A port number is a unique identifier used with an IP address. A port is a 16-bit unsigned integer.
  - Total no of poats are 131070.
- IP Address 
  - An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
